Transcribe the main performance date shown on a playbill to help researchers analyse patterns in performances.

The date usually appears in the first few lines of the playbill.

- The date format is dd/mm/yyyy - the day of the month goes first, then the month, then the year. In this example, it'd be 29/01/1829
- You don't need to type the day of the week
- Sometimes playbills mention upcoming or past performances - you can ignore them
- If you can't see a date, add a note to let us know
- Be careful not to accidentally transpose numbers and type '1979' instead of '1797' (for example)
- If you're used to American dates, be careful not to mix up the day and month
