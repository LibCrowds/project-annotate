!['Mark out a title'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LibCrowds/project-playbills/master/assets/mark_titles.gif)

In this task you'll mark out areas of the playbills listing the titles of upcoming play. When the entire volume of pages has been marked by three people, the marked titles are ready for the transcription task.

To mark out titles:
- Draw rectangles around the titles of plays featured on the next performance date. 
- When you're happy with the outline, press the green tick to save it. 
- If you make a mistake, just draw another rectangle or press the red 'x'.
- If you change your mind about a saved mark, you can delete by pressing the grey 'x' on the right-hand side. You can then redraw it. (This might not work on mobile or tablet devices).
- Press 'Save' when you're finished marking up a page.

Frequently answered questions:
- If you notice something interesting or odd about the playbill, or it needs to be reviewed, please let us know! Press the area that says 'Add a note' and type your comment in the white box that opens underneath. Your note will be saved when you save the next title.
- Most playbills list more than one play for an evening, so mark all you can see. 
- Please include subtitles (alternative titles, like 'or the something or other') where they exist. 
- Don't include the genre ('farce') etc - you can transcribe them in a separate task
- Ignore any performances on past or future dates. 
- You don't need to include song titles or scenery. If you're not sure if something counts as a play, then add a note and go ahead and mark it anyway.
