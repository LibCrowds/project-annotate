!['Transcribing a title'](https://cdn.rawgit.com/LibCrowds/project-playbills/b15721d6/assets/transcribe_titles.gif)

In this task, you're presented with one marked out title at a time. 

Type in the title exactly as displayed in the highlighted box on the page. Include any subtitles ('Or, the alternative name') and punctuation. You don't need to include the genre or description, or the initial 'The' or 'A' if it's not included in the marked box. 

There is an exception to 'type what you see': if you come across a 'long f' - for example, the 'Sufpicious Hufband', please use 's' instead of 'f' in your transcription.

If you notice something interesting or odd about the playbill, or it needs to be reviewed because e.g. a title wasn't marked, you can 'Add a note'. Click the area that says 'Add a note' and type your comment in the white box that opens underneath.

Once you're happy with your transcription, press the 'Save' button. The page will automatically load the next title.
