# project-annotate

Annotation project for LibCrowds.

## Requirements

This project uses [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/) to store annotations in realtime, see
[pybossa-rethinkdb](https://github.com/alexandermendes/pybossa-rethinkdb) for one way of setting started.
The [OpenSeadragon](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon) image viewer must also be provided by your theme.
