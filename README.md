# project-playbills-mark

Playbills marking projects for LibCrowds, designed for use with the 
[libcrowds-bs4-pybossa-theme](https://github.com/LibCrowds/libcrowds-bs4-pybossa-theme).


## Creating a new project

Choose a set of tasks from [tasks.json](tasks/tasks.json) (e.g. `"performances"`) 
and either an Aleph system number from the file 
[ark_and_aleph_system_numbers.csv](tasks/ark_and_aleph_system_numbers.csv) or 
the project ID of a completed 
[project-playbills-mark](https://github.com/LibCrowds/project-playbills-mark) 
project.

In reality, the `"performances"` tasks will be the only ones that should be 
generated by entering the aleph system number, where a new task will be created
for each image associated with that system number. Other task sets will be generated
from the results of one of these `"performances"` projects (or potentially other
marking projects), where a new task will be created for each image and region
now associated with that image. For these projects that region will then be
highlighted when the task is presented, so that we can drill down further and 
identify more specific types of information (actors etc.) while keeping this
information definitively associated with the parent (essentially simplyfying
the final data analysis process, avoiding issues that might otherwise be raised
by overlapping regions etc.).

To generate a new project using the inputs provided above and push it to the server:

```
python generate_project.py <task set> [--csv=<csv> or --project_id=<id>]
cd /gen
pbs create_project
pbs update-task-redundancy --redundancy 3
pbs update_project
```

The project can now be published from the project settings page.
