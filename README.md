# project-playbills

> Task generator for PyBossa projects implementing libcrowds-viewer >=3.0.0

This project does not provide a task presenter, results
or tutorial files, it merely generates the tasks.json and project.json files for
projects implementing
[LibCrowds Viewer](https://github.com/LibCrowds/libcrowds-viewer) >=3.0.0, such
as [vue-pybossa-frontend](https://github.com/LibCrowds/vue-pybossa-frontend).

Tasks are generated by choosing a task category from
[config/tasks.json](config/tasks.json), a IIIF manifest URI and an optional
JSON file containing the results data of a previous *project-playbills*
project.

When a JSON results file is provided a task will be created for each result,
and each region now associated with that, the idea being that tasks can be
chained to highlight increasingly more specific regions in the text (e.g. all
names associated with a title). When a JSON results file is not used a task
will be created for each image.

## Configuring

By default, the project is configured for the LibCrowds playbills site. However,
alternative configurations can easily be created by making a copy of the
[config](config) folder, editing the files contained within and providing the
location of this custom config directory when running the scripts below.

See [config/README.md](config/README.md) for more details about the various
configuration files.

## Usage

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and
[pbs](https://github.com/Scifabric/pbs), then:

```bash
# generate project files
python bin/generate.py <taskset> <manifest_uri> [--results] [--config] [--skip]

# deploy
cd dist
pbs create_project
pbs add_tasks --tasks-file=tasks.json
```

Once you have updated any additional settings on the server (category,
thumbnail, redundancy, webhooks etc.), the project is ready to be published.
