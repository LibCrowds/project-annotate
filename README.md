# project-playbills-mark

Playbills marking projects for LibCrowds, designed for use with the 
[libcrowds-bs4-pybossa-theme](https://github.com/LibCrowds/libcrowds-bs4-pybossa-theme).


## Creating a new project

Choose a set of tasks from [tasks.json](tasks/tasks.json) (e.g. `"performances"`) 
and either an Aleph system number from the file 
[ark_and_aleph_system_numbers.csv](tasks/ark_and_aleph_system_numbers.csv) or 
the project ID of a completed 
[project-playbills-mark](https://github.com/LibCrowds/project-playbills-mark) 
project.

In reality, the `"performances"` tasks will be the only ones generated by 
entering the Aleph system number, where a new task will be created
for each image associated with that system number. 

Other task sets will be generated from the results of a previous marking project, 
where a new task will be created for each image and region now associated with 
that image. These regions will be highlighted when the task is presented, so 
that we can drill down further and identify more specific types of "child" 
data (e.g. the actors associated with a performance). This should simplify the final 
data analysis process, avoiding any issues that might otherwise be raised by 
overlapping regions etc.

To generate a new project using the inputs provided above and push it to the server:

```
python generate_project.py <task set> [--sysno=<sysno> or --project_id=<id>]
cd /gen
pbs create_project
pbs update-task-redundancy --redundancy 3
pbs update_project
```

The project can now be published from the project settings page.
