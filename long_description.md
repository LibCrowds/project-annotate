The Library’s collection of playbills is one of the biggest in the world – there are over 200,000 individual playbills mostly dating from the late-18th to the late-19th centuries designed to entice theatre-goers to performances in their local area. Many of them are extremely fragile, since playbills were intended to be thrown away soon after a production was completed, and it is only thanks to a few major collectors we have them in the national collections today. 

With your help we aim to preserve these important artifacts for future generations...

The playbills cover theatres in Bath (Royal), Bristol (Royal), Dublin (Royal), Edinburgh (miscellaneous), Hull (Royal), King's Lynn, Liverpool (Royal), London (Covent Garden, Drury Lane, Lyceum , Princess's, Old Vic, Olympic) , Manchester (Royal), Margate (Royal), Market Drayton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Nottingham (Royal and miscellaneous), Plymouth (miscellaneous), Portsmouth, Scarborough, Stafford (Royal), Tyneside (Newcastle upon-Tyne), Windsor (Castle), Wolverhampton and York (Royal), among others.
